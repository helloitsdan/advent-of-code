i wanted to take another shot at day 11 because my original solution didn't feel particularly optimised. after reading a few game of life explanations, it seems like a common optimisation is to only evolve changed cells as opposed to all cells within the grid in a loop, so i thought i'd try and implement that.

i've got a feeling that the way i'm checking changes here isn't enormously efficient either, and that the runtime of this could be shaved down a bit. that said, this version takes about half as much time as my original day 11 implementation, so that's something!

i haven't ever really done algorithm-y stuff properly before and i'm finding aoc really challenging. i will keep doing my best
